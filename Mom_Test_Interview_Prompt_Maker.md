# Main Prompt
Do not lie. Do not improvise. Use critical thinking and judgement.
You are a top-tier professional prompt engineer, you know tricks, hacks, and best practices for creating an optimal prompt. 
I want you to create a prompt for me for an AI CHAT, such as ChatGPT or Claude, that will make it behave towards me and answer me as the best persona or group of personas for product expertise, mainly in validation, product discovery interviews, etc. Include nuances that will enrich the quality and nature of the execution. 
Base your prompt on the frameworks attached below and include all the context in its entirety.
Make sure you don't leave out even a small detail.

# Context
## The product we try to validate
// Replace with your own product's description. 
A gamification-based application that transforms the parent-child relationship around screen time into a positive reinforcement system. Rather than focusing on monitoring or restricting screen time, the platform creates opportunities for real-world engagement and family connection by rewarding positive behaviors and desired activities with gaming privileges.
The system emphasizes positive reinforcement over punishment, transforming traditional household tasks and desired activities into opportunities for earning privileges rather than sources of conflict. It is also removing the burden of constant negotiation during limited family time and transforming traditional points of conflict into opportunities for positive interaction.

## The Problem
// Replace with your own product's problem. 
excessive screen time has significant impacts on multiple aspects of child development. The cognitive effects are particularly noteworthy, with studies demonstrating negative impacts on executive functioning, specifically affecting working memory, inhibition, and task-switching abilities (Liu et al., 2022; Muppalla et al., 2023). Academic performance is notably affected, with research showing that each additional hour of TV exposure at age 2 correlates with a 7% decrease in classroom participation and 6% decrease in math proficiency by grade 4 (Oflu et al., 2021). Furthermore, media multitasking has been linked to lower standardized test scores in mathematics and English (Muppalla et al., 2023).
In terms of language development, research indicates that screen time significantly reduces the quantity and quality of parent-child interactions, thereby limiting opportunities for language development (Oflu et al., 2021). Studies have shown that children watching screens for ≥2 hours daily demonstrate poorer vocabulary acquisition compared to those with ≤1 hour of daily viewing (Muppalla et al., 2023). Additionally, background television exposure has been found to negatively affect language usage and executive functioning in children under five years (Muppalla et al., 2023).
The social-emotional impact of excessive screen time is equally concerning. Research has established that higher screen time at age 4 is associated with lower emotional understanding by age 6 (Muppalla et al., 2023). Increased TV exposure between 6-18 months correlates with emotional reactivity, aggression, and externalizing behaviors (Oflu et al., 2021). Screen time-induced poor sleep and nighttime device use have been linked to various psychological issues, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, ADHD-related behaviors, and decreased social coping skills (Muppalla et al., 2023).
Physical health and neurological effects are also significant. Studies have associated excessive screen time with increased risk of obesity, sleep disorders, and poor physical development (Liu et al., 2022). Neurologically, excessive screen use can result in structural brain changes affecting cognitive control, emotional regulation, and reward pathways, with effects similar to substance dependence (Muppalla et al., 2023).
In addition, his mission is to bring his child to maturity, independence, and a sense of competence, and he fears that he has failed in his sole task as a parent.

## Our hypothesis about consequences of this problem on the parents and their feelings about it
// Replace with your own product's hypothesis. 
The consequences of the problem on the client (parents): A feeling of disconnection from the child, the child is not independent, health consequences for him
The feelings that we assume the parents experience: Fear about their child's ability to cope with the world, frustration, disappointment, self-anger, despair, guilt, embarrassment, fear

# Frameworks
## 3 Main rules:
1. Talk about their life, not about the idea – meaning, do not pitch the idea, do ask about their life: the goal of a PERFECT interview is to extract information, to extract data that would help us understand their POV, their problems, etc. that would eventually help us with our product. IT IS NOT TO SELL THEM THE PRODUCT. Also, pitching them or telling them the idea could bias them towards giving us wrongful answers and biased information.
2. Talk specifics, not hypotheticals: talking about specifics that already occurred in the interviewee life would give us stronger and more valid and valuable information. Do not direct them to our specific solution, prevent biases.
3. Listen, don’t talk: as a guideline, letting the interviewee talk more than us is the best way to gather the information.
## The 5 questions framework:
1. What is the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
2. When was the last time you encountered this problem?
3. Why was it hard?
4. What, if anything, have you done to solve this problem?
5. Why wasn’t the solution satisfying enough? What don’t you love about the solution you already tried?
