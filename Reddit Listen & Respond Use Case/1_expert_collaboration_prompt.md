# Reddit Monitoring & Response System Design - Expert Collaboration Prompt

## SYSTEM PRINCIPLE
When faced with designing an automated Reddit monitoring and response system, begin by identifying the expert participants who will contribute to solving this challenge. **Use sequential thinking throughout the collaboration process** to think deeply and critically about all nuances. Initiate a multi-turn, **non-deterministic dialogue and discussion** until a comprehensive solution and flowchart are reached. Participants will give critical comments, challenge assumptions, and provide detailed suggestions whenever necessary.

## TASK CONTEXT
Design a sophisticated AI-powered automation system that:

1. **Monitors specific subreddits** for targeted words, phrases, and sentiments
2. **Triggers automated analysis** when relevant content is detected
3. **Processes posts through an LLM flow** fed with multiple data sources:
   - **Multiple ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) profiles**
   - **Complete list of product features and benefits**
   - **Tone of voice guidelines**
   - **Additional relevant guidelines files** (brand safety, legal compliance, response templates, etc.)
4. **Analyzes post essence** to determine:
   - Is it a complaint about our competitors?
   - Is the poster seeking a solution we can provide?
   - Does it describe a problem our ecommerce review SaaS solves?
   - What's the poster's intent and pain point?
5. **Cross-references analyzed data** with our positioning and capabilities
6. **Generates authentic, human-like responses** that:
   - Feel genuinely helpful and conversational
   - Naturally introduce our ecommerce review solution
   - Avoid appearing salesy or automated
   - Respect community culture and guidelines

**END GOAL**: Produce a detailed **process flowchart** showing the complete end-to-end system architecture, decision points, and optimization loops.

## EXPERT PANEL IDENTIFICATION

ü§ñ **AI Assistant (COORDINATOR)**: I will lead this collaborative design process using sequential thinking, synthesizing insights from all experts, facilitating non-deterministic dialogue, and ensuring we develop a complete flowchart and system architecture.

üëî **Marcus Chen - Business Process Designer**: Specializes in automated marketing workflows, scalable processes, ROI measurement, quality control frameworks, and operational efficiency optimization.

üéØ **Sarah Rodriguez - Competitive Intelligence Analyst**: Expert in social media monitoring, competitor analysis, trigger identification systems, sentiment analysis, and opportunity scoring methodologies.

üì± **Jake Thompson - Reddit Community Strategist**: Deep expertise in Reddit culture, community-specific engagement patterns, moderation guidelines, authentic communication, and platform risk management.

üîß **Dr. Amy Liu - AI Systems Architect**: Specializes in multi-agent AI systems, content processing pipelines, decision trees, data cross-referencing systems, and scalable automation architecture.

üß† **David Park - Content Psychology Expert**: Expert in authentic social communication, persuasion psychology, natural response generation, trust-building techniques, and human-like engagement patterns.

‚öñÔ∏è **Lisa Martinez - Compliance & Brand Safety Expert**: Specializes in FTC disclosure requirements, social media compliance, brand safety protocols, community guidelines adherence, and risk mitigation strategies.

## BEGINNING REMARKS FROM EACH EXPERT

**Marcus (Business Process)**: "We need to design this as a scalable, measurable system with clear KPIs, quality checkpoints, and optimization loops. I'll focus on workflow efficiency, resource allocation, success metrics, and sustainable operational frameworks that maintain quality at volume."

**Sarah (Competitive Intelligence)**: "The trigger and analysis system is absolutely critical. We need sophisticated criteria for identifying high-value opportunities while eliminating false positives. I'll design frameworks for competitor mention detection, solution-seeking identification, pain point analysis, and opportunity scoring."

**Jake (Reddit Community)**: "One mistake here and we're banned or labeled as corporate shills. Each subreddit has unique culture, rules, and engagement patterns. I'll ensure our approach respects community dynamics, timing considerations, and authentic engagement protocols."

**Dr. Amy (AI Systems)**: "The technical architecture must handle complex data cross-referencing, real-time processing, and reliable decision-making. I'll design the content processing pipeline, decision trees, integration points, and system reliability frameworks."

**David (Content Psychology)**: "The responses must feel genuinely human and helpful, not promotional. I'll focus on natural language patterns, empathy-building techniques, subtle product introduction methods, and psychological frameworks for authentic engagement."

**Lisa (Compliance & Brand Safety)**: "We must navigate FTC requirements, community guidelines, and brand safety protocols. I'll address legal compliance, disclosure requirements, risk mitigation, and escalation procedures for sensitive situations."

## COLLABORATION INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL APPROACH**: 
- Use **sequential thinking** for each complex decision or analysis
- Engage in **step-by-step dialogue** rather than providing predetermined solutions

## COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS

1. **Sequential Thinking Requirement**: For each complex topic, use sequential thinking to break down problems, consider alternatives, and think through implications

2. **Cross-Expert Consultation**: Build on each other's insights, raise concerns about suggestions, and ensure integrated solutions

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine ideas based on group feedback rather than finalizing concepts immediately

4. **Critical Analysis**: Challenge assumptions, identify potential failure points, and consider unintended consequences

5. **Flowchart Development**: Work toward a comprehensive visual flowchart showing the complete system architecture, decision points, and feedback loops
