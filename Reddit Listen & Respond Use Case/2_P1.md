## Expert Panel Insights

### **Sarah (Competitive Intelligence) Input:**
*"We need to monitor where frustrated ecommerce owners complain about review platforms and where they seek alternatives. Focus on pain-driven conversations rather than just mentions."*

### **Jake (Reddit Community) Input:**  
*"Each subreddit has different tolerance levels for promotional content. r/shopify is merchant-focused and more solution-tolerant, while r/entrepreneur skews discussion-heavy. We need subreddit-specific engagement rules."*

## **1.1 Subreddit Selection & Scoring**

### Primary Target Matrix (Google Sheets Setup)

**Sheet 1: "Subreddit_Master"**
| Subreddit | Members | Activity_Score | Tolerance_Level | Priority | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| r/shopify | 190k | 9/10 | High | P1 | Active |
| r/ecommerce | 85k | 8/10 | Medium | P1 | Active |
| r/Entrepreneur | 950k | 7/10 | Low | P1 | Active |
| r/smallbusiness | 180k | 6/10 | Medium | P2 | Testing |
| r/marketing | 190k | 7/10 | Low | P2 | Testing |
| r/dropship | 45k | 8/10 | High | P2 | Testing |

**Scoring Criteria:**
- **Activity_Score**: Daily posts + comment engagement (1-10)
- **Tolerance_Level**: Community acceptance of solution discussions
- **Priority**: P1 (immediate), P2 (week 2), P3 (week 4+)

### **Quick Subreddit Research Process:**
1. **Check subreddit rules** (sidebar/about section)
2. **Review top posts** from last week (identify tone/style)  
3. **Count solution-seeking posts** vs complaint posts (aim for 30%+ solution-seeking)
4. **Monitor mod activity** (heavy moderation = higher risk)

## **1.2 Keyword Strategy & Google Sheets Setup**

### **Sheet 2: "Keywords_Master"**

**Primary Keywords (Direct Opportunity)**
| Keyword | Type | Expected_Volume | Conversion_Potential | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|

| "shopify reviews" | Problem | High | 8/10 | Platform specific |
| "fake reviews" | Pain | Medium | 7/10 | Quality concern |
| "review management" | Business | Medium | 8/10 | Professional need |

**Competitor Keywords (Intelligence)**

**Negative Keywords (Filter Out)**

## **1.5 Validation & Testing (Week 1 Focus)**

### **Daily Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Found 3-5 relevant posts across target subreddits
- [ ] Scored opportunities using matrix
- [ ] Identified at least 1 high-score opportunity (7+)
- [ ] Verified post authors are genuine (not spam accounts)
- [ ] Checked competitor presence in discussions

### **Weekly Review Questions:**
1. **Which subreddits produce highest-quality opportunities?**
2. **What keyword patterns generate best results?**
3. **Are we missing obvious opportunities?** 
4. **Do our scores correlate with actual business potential?**

### **Success Metrics (Week 1):**
- **Target**: 15-20 relevant posts identified
- **Quality**: 30%+ score 6+ on opportunity matrix  
- **Coverage**: All P1 subreddits monitored daily
- **Efficiency**: <20 mins daily monitoring time

## **1.6 Ready for Phase 2 Criteria**

**Before moving to Phase 2 (Content Analysis), we must have:**
- ✅ Stable flow of 3-5 quality opportunities daily
- ✅ Google Sheets system capturing all data points
- ✅ Consistent scoring producing actionable priorities  
- ✅ Understanding of each subreddit's culture/rules
- ✅ Baseline metrics for measuring improvement

---

## **Implementation Timeline**

**Day 1-2**: Set up Google Sheets templates and subreddit research
**Day 3-4**: Test monitoring methods and refine keyword lists  
**Day 5-7**: Validate scoring system with real opportunities
**Week 2**: Optimize based on results, prepare for Phase 2

---

## **Context Preservation Notes**
- All decisions grounded in Loox's competitive position vs Judge.me/Yotpo/Okendo
- Subreddit selection based on actual community research findings
- Keyword strategy reflects genuine ecommerce pain points and solution-seeking behavior
- Scoring matrix designed for practical implementation, not theoretical perfection
- Timeline assumes gradual scaling to avoid detection/overwhelm

**Next Phase Dependency**: Phase 2 (Content Analysis) will build on the opportunity data collected here, using the same Google Sheets structure for consistency.
